# UnityCheckAudioPlaying

> The package includes the scene and scrtips to check if all the audio sources in the scene are playing. 

The script has two ways for testing, you choose whichever is useful to you. 

1. Goes over an array of audio objects, and if they are all playing, then do something
  
2. Uses  LINQ (Language Integrated Query), to go over the list of elements, and if they are true, then do something
